\subsection{Detailed Description}
Multivariate Normal distribution sampling using C++11 and \hyperlink{namespaceEigen}{Eigen} matrices.

I have been unable to contact the original author, and I've performed the following modifications to the original code\-:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item removal of the dependency to Boost, in favor of straight C++11;
\item ability to choose from Solver or Cholesky decomposition (supposedly faster);
\item fixed Cholesky by using L\-L\-T decomposition instead of L\-D\-L\-T that was not yielding a correctly rotated variance (see this \href{http://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/48749/how-to-sample-from-a-multivariate-normal-given-the-pt-ldlt-p-decomposition-o}{\tt http\-://stats.\-stackexchange.\-com/questions/48749/how-\/to-\/sample-\/from-\/a-\/multivariate-\/normal-\/given-\/the-\/pt-\/ldlt-\/p-\/decomposition-\/o} ) Copyright (c) 2014 by Emmanuel Benazera \href{mailto:beniz@droidnik.fr}{\tt beniz@droidnik.\-fr}, All rights reserved.
